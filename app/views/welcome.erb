            <h3>Inspiration</h3>
            <p> 
                Growing up we spent a lot of time hanging around the neighorhood electrical box. I didn't realize it was a childhood rite of passage wasn't until everyone I met had a story of hanging out there. This site is inspired to recall old forgotten memories and bring everyone around the electrical box again.‚Äç <br><br>
                Feel free to share your story, a friends story, or a childhood memory in general.
